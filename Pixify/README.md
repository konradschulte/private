Project Description

My currently biggest private project. The code reads in several "part" pictures and one "target" picture. It then splits up the target picture into a predefined amount of squares. In a next step, the code searches the most similar "part" picture to every square. Finally, the code recreates the target picture with all the respective part pictures.
