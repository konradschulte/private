Project Description

My very first private coding project. The code attempts to solve a sudoku puzzle using a combination of data from a CSV file, and data manipulation using the Pandas library. The program reads a CSV file named "Sudoku.csv" and then sets up a "perfect" set with the numbers 1-9 and a loop variable. It then uses these variables to create a series of lists that split the sudoku puzzle into rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids. These lists are then used to check for any errors in the puzzle, and potentially make changes to it in order to solve the puzzle.
