Project Description

In this project I created the GUI for a game in our summer holiday called "Summerlympics" which is a collection of mini games. The games are represented by buttons on the user interface. The 15 mini games are stored as variables in a dictionary. There are two players, player 1 and player 2. Each player has a score and a progress bar. The code also has a counter that is used to keep track of the current game. The first game is worth 1 point, the second 2 points and so on.
